### Capstone Proposal

#### Name of Student: Mo Byrne

#### Name of Project: Studio Ten Fifteen

#### Project's Purpose: Website for a small clothing business. The owner will be able to post and sell individual pieces. 

#### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Post an item
* Item can be moved into a cart
* Item can be purchased
* A notification of purchase is sent to an email
* Item is removed from site, or marked as sold, at purchase

#### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* React
* Sanity
* Stripe API for payment

#### Stretch goals: this is a big project, and I don't expect to finish it while in school, so there is a lot I will be able to work on if I complete my MVP.

* A page about the company
* Size chart
* Contact info
* Photo gallery
* CSS styling
* Possibly a page with info about other local businesses

#### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* Bootstrap
* CSS
